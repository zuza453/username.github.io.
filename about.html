<h2 id="about2"> The Overview </h2>
    
    <p id="about">Many unmoderated online spaces cause the spread of alt-right and fascist ideas from their supporters, onto children and young adults. These online spaces and communities often reside on websites such as Reddit, 4chan, and Voat to gather in large numbers and freely spread their ideas among each other and any newcomers. Followers of such ideas also turn to other social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, or Facebook to then trend hashtags, gain followers, or spread their misinformation to a larger, more diverse, audience. These spaces are populated by far-right extremists, fascists, white supremacists, men's right's activists ( which will be disscussed and explained later on), and other labels which all produce inherently violent individuals. The purpose of this page is to educate all internet users on terms and phrases used by these extremists, define them in a clear and understandable manner, and warn those who come accross this sort of language and behavior to not engage with any of the people involved. These following words and phrases are some of the most necessary vocabulary needed to fully understand the topic at hand, and be aware of the spaces we are in while online.</p>

                 <strong> Reddit and 4chan </strong> - Websites popular for being occupied by users who subscribe to these extremist views and use these sites to share ideas and plans with other members.

<strong> Red Pill </strong> - A reference to the Matrix, in which character Neo is presented with two pills, a red and blue one. The red pill reveals the Matrix to him, while the blue allows him to return to normal life. This is a metaphor that suggests that subscribing to alt-right views will reveal the metaphorical 'Matrix' to the person. Can also be used as "Red Pilling", refering to converting someone else to the alt-right.
