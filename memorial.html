<p id="mems">Due to the inherently violent nature of the alt-right, there have been many violent outburts, which resulted in many deaths, done by the different members of the fascist communities. This page is dedicated to all of the individuals who lost their lives in a cruel and unjust manner. It is important to remember their names, their situations, and the fact that their innovent lives were taken away from them. The fact that many people have died because of said online communities proves how severe of an issue this is, and how hard we must work in order to stop the online radicalization of kids and young adults.</p>
