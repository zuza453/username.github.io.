    <h1>STOP ONLINE FASCIST RADICALIZATION</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id=intro2> The Cause </h2>
    <p id="intro"> The spread of unregulated and unmoderated online content in the form of websites, forums, and communities has led to a consequence most would not expect: the spread of facsist ideologies and beliefs. Many communities that reside on popular websites such as Reddit or 4chan have continued to spread fascist and extremely far right ideas to their members and anyone who happens to stumble into their corner of the internet. These types of ideas encourage people to proundy identify as 'facsists', 'incels', and many other labels which are inherently violent. The individuals who frequent said chatrooms and communities often feel a great sense of anger and resentment towards all of those who do not share their same beleifs, and turn to violent outbursts in forms of terrorists attacks or mass murder to releive their anger and prove themselves to their fellow community members. Websites such as those mentioned before, and even ones which are more mainstream such as YouTube or Twitter, claim to regulate and moderate the content posted by their users, when in reality more often than not, users who engage in extremist and facsits behaviors freely form their own communites,subreddits, boards, and other forms of spreading their harmful beleifs. The one and only solution to stopping the extreme far right radicalization of children and young adults who visit these websites is to enforce strict bans on any content containing such ideas, permanently removing the harmful user and all of their content from the website, and encouraging parents and all internet users to learn about the dangers of engaging with such communities.  </p>

<h2 id='cause'>The Purpose</h2>
  <p id="cont"> The purpose of this website is to inform others about the dangers of these remote communities. It is also here to help commemorate those who lost their lives due to attacks commited by members of said communities who felt the need to prove their devotion to their beliefs. Finally, a large motivation behind this site is to provide resources to those who need help, as they feel they've fallen too deep into these communities and are developing violent urges and ideas, or feel someone close to them has started frequenting these sites and communities and is in need of help themselves. The main goal is not to humiliate and embarass those who have fallen victim to online radicalization, but instead provide them with the appropriate counseling they need and allow them to rethink their beliefs and core values.  </p>
